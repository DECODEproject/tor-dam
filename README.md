Installation
------------

```
go get -u github.com/parazyd/tor-dam/...
```

### Dependencies

#### Go

```
golang.org/x/crypto/ed25519
golang.org/x/crypto/sha3
golang.org/x/net/proxy
github.com/go-redis/redis
github.com/cretz/bine/tor
```

#### Python 3

```
https://stem.torproject.org/
```

The Go dependencies should be pulled in with `go get`. You can install
`stem` possibly with your package manager, or download it from the
website itself. `stem` needs to be at least version `1.7.0`.

To install everything else, go to the directory where go has downloaded
tor-dam and run `make install` as root.

External software dependencies include `redis` and `tor`. You can
retrieve them using your package manager. Tor has to be at least version
`0.3`, to support V3 hidden services.

Tor needs to have ControlPort enabled, and has to allow either
CookieAuthentication or a password, for stem to authenticate and be able
to create hidden services and retrieve hidden service descriptors.

Redis is our storage backend where information about nodes is held.

Working configurations are provided in the `contrib` directory.


### Operation example(s)

By default, ports 13010:13010,13011:13011,5000:5000 are mapped by
tor-dam. (see: tor-dam/pkg/damlib/config.go:48)

To serve a basic echo server behind this, issue the following on the
recipient side:

```
nc -l 5000
```

and the following on the sender's side:

```
echo 'HELLO' | torsocks nc <address.onion> 5000
```

You can find the onion address either in redis, or in the `.dam`
directory.
